# Handoff

For whichever agent picks this project up next. Read this before touching
anything — several things here are non-obvious and have already cost real
debugging time once.

**This file and `CHANGELOG.md` are kept current after every action, not
just at the end of a session** — so if you're resuming mid-session rather
than between sessions, both should still be accurate as of the last thing
that happened. If you add, fix, or change something meaningful, update the
relevant section here and add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry as part of that same
piece of work, not as an afterthought at the end.

## What this project is

A microscopy capture + calibration + measurement suite for a Raspberry Pi 5
with an IMX477 HQ camera. See `README.md` for the architecture map and the
measurement-integrity invariants (green-plane-only measurement, append-only
calibration, hash-pinned marks) — those are load-bearing design rules, not
suggestions, and nothing in this handoff repeats them.

## Current state (as of this handoff)

The build checklist referenced throughout commit messages and code comments
has 12 of 13 sections complete:

| § | What | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 0–7, 9, 10 | Invariants, seams, pixel hash, stores, wizards, capture GUI, focus aid, canvas/tools, annotations, CA display | ✅ done |
| 8 | Z-stack view (filmstrip + onion-skin) | ✅ done |
| 11 | Export (flat JSON results) | ✅ done |
| 12 | Publication (provenance manifests) | ✅ done |
| 13 | Later items: **post-capture QC** ✅, **objective/config-change invalidation** ✅, **poly2 CA model** ⏳ deferred |

The one open item is the poly2 chromatic-aberration model
(`m(r) = 1 + c1·r² + c2·r⁴`). It was explicitly deferred — `poly2_flag()`
already detects when a CA fit's outer annulus curves away from the fitted
line, but no actual target has shown that curvature yet, and building the
correction model without real evidence to validate against would be
speculative. Don't build it until someone hits it.

That 13-section checklist is a separate, older track from the newer
`BUILD_LIST.md` (planning doc, not checked into the repo) the user is now
working through in dependency order. Progress so far: Tier 1 items 1
(focus aid tick rate + auto-reset on stack tag), 2 (`measure.py`'s stale
tool-status text after a mark commits), and 5 (video resolution menu —
see the note below; a persisted next-launch preference, not a live
change, and the build list undersold how non-trivial "wire it up" turned
out to be) are done. Tier 3 item 4 (Gallery module) is done — see
`gallery.py` below. Tier 3 item 5 (processing wizard overhaul) is done —
see `process_wizard.py` below. Tier 3 item 6 (the z-stack one-click aid,
the thing the user actually asked for) is also done. **Remaining Tier 1
items (3: themes, 4: single green-plane extraction utility) are next,
unblocked, no investigation needed.**

**Video resolution menu detail worth knowing**: `camera_backend.py`'s
`Picamera2Camera.set_video_resolution()` has never had a live effect —
recording always encodes the preview config's fixed "main" stream, set
once at construction — despite a stale comment in `__init__` claiming
otherwise (it describes an abandoned mode-switching design;
`start_recording`'s own history notes are the accurate account). The new
Options > "Video resolution" menu in `qt_shell.py` writes a `gui_prefs.json`
preference via the new `video_resolution_kwargs()` helper, which `main()`
reads at camera-construction time (`Picamera2Camera(**video_resolution_
kwargs(...))`) — takes effect next launch, not immediately, and the
status text says so. If you ever want this to apply live, that means
tearing down and rebuilding the camera+widget while running; think hard
about it first, given this project's track record with in-session camera
reconfiguration (see `start_recording`'s own docstring).

It lives entirely in `qt_shell.py`'s `FocusPreviewWindow`:

- `zstack_btn` ("Start Z-Stack" / "End Z-Stack (N planes)") mirrors
  `_toggle_recording`'s own two-state shape exactly: press to start
  (captures plane 0 immediately as part of starting, via
  `_start_zstack` → `_capture_zstack_plane`), press again to end
  (`_end_zstack`). `self._zstack` is `None` when inactive, else
  `{"root": Path, "stack_id": str, "next_plane": int}`.
- The **existing** Capture button/menu action (`_start_capture`) gets a
  branch at its very top: while `self._zstack is not None`, every press
  repurposes to `_capture_zstack_plane()` (next plane) instead of its
  normal untagged-snap behavior — this is the only reading of the build
  list's "one button... each subsequent press... a distinct action (same
  button again, mirroring Record)" that makes "mirroring Record" literally
  true, since Record itself is a pure two-state toggle with nothing in
  between. No second new button was needed.
- Folder layout: `~/captures/zstack_<timestamp>/plane_0/`, `plane_1/`,
  ... — each plane its own real, independent `Session`, via a small,
  backward-compatible `Session.__init__(..., session_dir=None)` extension
  (skips the usual auto-timestamped `new_session_dir` call when an exact
  directory is given). `new_zstack_root_dir` mints the stack's own root +
  `stack_id` (the timestamp itself, reused — no second ID scheme).
- Each plane capture: `camera.capture_burst(dir, "science_", 1)` →
  `record_burst(..., "science", ...)` → `stacks.apply_tag` + `session.
  write()` (the same two calls `_on_tag_stack` already makes manually,
  just automatic) → `_score_capture_sharpness`, on a worker thread with
  its own `zstack_plane_done_signal` (kept separate from `burst_done_
  signal`, which is hardwired to `self._session`/`self._batch_active` —
  both wrong here).
- While a stack is active, `capture_kind_combo`/`record_btn` are disabled
  (mirrors Record's own mutual-exclusion of `capture_kind_combo`);
  `capture_btn`/`_capture_action` stay enabled and repurposed.
- Ending the stack runs `stacks.validate_all` over the plane folders and
  shows the result, then offers (never forces, matching `_offer_process`'s
  own precedent) to open `process_wizard.ProcessWizard(out_root=<stack's
  own root folder>)` with every plane pre-selected. Gallery is naturally
  scoped to just this stack's planes because `list_gallery_entries` treats
  `out_root`'s own immediate children as sessions, and the stack root's
  immediate children ARE exactly this stack's `plane_N/` folders — no
  changes were needed in `gallery.py` or `process_wizard.py` for this.

**Testing note for anyone extending this**: the render-check's own z-stack
coverage does NOT bypass the worker-thread/signal machinery the way
`_on_tag_stack`'s test does for the single-shot async path — it drives the
real button handlers and pumps `QApplication.processEvents()` in a loop
until `self._capturing` clears, because `zstack_plane_done_signal` is a
genuinely cross-thread QUEUED connection (worker thread → GUI-thread slot)
that a real event loop would drain automatically but a headless script
must pump itself. If you add another worker-thread-backed z-stack method,
test it the same way, not by calling its completion handler directly.

Four standalone tools, one shared GUI entry point:

- `python3 qt_shell.py [--camera]` — live capture GUI. Has **Calibrate** and
  **Measure** menu items that open `calibrate.py`'s and `measure.py`'s
  windows as separate, non-modal windows (see "Menu integration pattern"
  below). Session/profile management (`Session`, `load_profile`,
  `new_session_dir`, ...) that used to live in a separate `capture.py` is
  now baked directly into this file — `capture.py` was deleted this session
  because it wasn't sensor-specific and had no reason to be its own module.
- `python3 calibrate.py [image] [--objective NAME]` — spatial (µm/px)
  calibration, standalone or via its own wizard (no args).
- `python3 ca_measure.py [target] -o out.json` / `--wizard` — chromatic
  aberration calibration, standalone or via its own wizard.
- `python3 measure.py [image] [--objective NAME]` — the analysis GUI:
  4 measurement tools, z-stack filmstrip with onion-skin, export, publish.
  Reachable from `qt_shell.py`'s Measure menu, or run directly.

`gallery.py` is a fifth, shared (not standalone) module: a capture-browsing
grid widget, thumbnails from the JPG previews already written alongside
every raw capture. Two modes off one `GalleryWidget` — `GalleryPickDialog`
(multi-select-capable; replaced the plain `QFileDialog.getOpenFileName` in
`wizard_pages.py`'s `ImageSourcePage`, `measure.py`'s and `calibrate.py`'s
own `_on_open`) and `GalleryBrowseWindow` (`qt_shell.py`'s new "Browse
captures..." File menu action, just looking, no commit). Whether a capture
already has annotations is checked lazily, in a background `QThread`, only
against the real green-plane substrate (`measure.load_measurement_plane`) —
**never** a display-referred derivative like `final_display.tif`, which is
structurally excluded from `annotations.json` (see `check_measurement_
provenance`) and would silently under-report if hashed instead.

`process_wizard.py` is a sixth shared module, built on `gallery.py`: the
"choose your operations" processing wizard (`ProcessWizard`, a 3-page
`QWizard` — select files via an embedded `GalleryWidget`, pick green/rgb +
optional color-correct gains, run). Reachable from `qt_shell.py`'s new
"Process files..." File menu action, deliberately separate from the older
"Process session..." (`ProcessSessionDialog`/`hdr_from_session.py`), which
stays untouched — that one is still the right tool for a session's own
recorded HDR bracket; this one is for an arbitrary set of Gallery captures
or loose files. It does **not** support HDR-merge grouping from arbitrary
files (see `process_wizard.py`'s own module docstring for why that's a
deliberate cut, not a gap) — if that need ever shows up for real, don't
bolt it onto this wizard's `_OperationsPage` without rereading that
docstring first.

Every module with real logic has a headless self-check:
`python3 <module>.py --render-check`. Run the whole set before trusting
anything:

```bash
for m in pixel_hash annotations export publish calibrate measure ca_measure \
        wizard_pages qt_shell stacks focus gallery process_wizard; do
  DISPLAY=:0 python3 $m.py --render-check || echo "FAILED: $m"
done
```

All 11 currently pass (some — `stacks.py`, `focus.py` — only gained a
`--render-check` this session; they didn't have one before). `stacks.py`
and `focus.py` and `calibrate.py`'s new pure functions run fine without
PyQt5 or a display; `qt_shell.py`/`measure.py` have PyQt5-gated checks that
print `SKIPPED` (not `FAILED`) when PyQt5 isn't importable — that's
correct, expected behavior, not a bug to chase.

## Things that will bite you if you don't know them

**A render-check that HANGS (not fails) right after loading an image is
almost certainly a blocking `QMessageBox` with no one to click it.**
`_load_image`-style methods across this project catch a load failure and
call `QMessageBox.warning(...)`, which is a real modal `.exec_()` — fine in
the real app, but in a headless `--render-check` run there is no user to
dismiss it, so the process just sits there forever instead of failing
loudly. Hit this for real writing `measure.py`'s mark-commit status-line
test: it reused `green_path`, a fixture file an EARLIER check in the same
`render_check()` had already `unlink()`ed in its own `finally:` block, so
the reload raised, and the resulting warning dialog hung the test with no
error message at all — `timeout <n> python3 -u foo.py --render-check` (the
`-u` matters; stdout is block-buffered when not a tty, so without it you
see nothing before the timeout kills it) is what actually revealed where
it stopped. Lesson: give any UI-driving render-check test its own
self-contained fixture files, never reuse another check's, even one that
looks like it should still be sitting there.

**Circular import chain — `wizard_pages.py`'s qt_shell import MUST be
lazy.** The load order is `qt_shell.py → calibrate.py → wizard_pages.py`
(both `qt_shell` and `calibrate` import `wizard_pages` at module level, for
`ImageSourcePage`). If `wizard_pages.py` ever imports `qt_shell` at module
level too (for `new_session_dir` or the overlay-render helpers), the cycle
closes and one of the three fails to import depending on which one Python
loads first. Both of `wizard_pages.py`'s reasons to reach into `qt_shell`
are deferred into a lazy `_lazy_qt_shell()` helper, called only at actual
use time, never at import time. If you add a new cross-reference between
any of `{qt_shell, calibrate, measure, ca_measure, wizard_pages}`, check the
import graph before assuming a top-level import is safe.

**Same rule applies to `gallery.py`, one level further.** `qt_shell.py`,
`measure.py`, and `calibrate.py` all reach into `gallery.py` (for
`GalleryBrowseWindow`/`GalleryPickDialog`); `qt_shell.py` does it as a
top-level guarded import (safe — `gallery.py`'s own top level only pulls in
`stacks`/`annotations`/`pixel_hash`, none of which import anything back),
but `wizard_pages.py`, `measure.py`, and `calibrate.py`'s own `_on_open`
methods import `gallery` *lazily, inside the method*, not at module top
level — those three are exactly the modules `gallery.py` itself needs
(`measure.load_measurement_plane`, for the annotation check), so a
top-level import in either direction would close a new cycle. If you touch
`gallery.py`'s imports, keep `qt_shell`/`measure` lazy inside
`capture_has_annotation`/`_lazy_qt_shell`/`_lazy_measure`, same shape as
`wizard_pages.py`'s existing `_lazy_qt_shell`.

`process_wizard.py` sits one level further out and needs no lazy trick of
its own: it top-level imports `gallery` and `hdr_from_session` (neither
imports `process_wizard` back, and `hdr_from_session.py` needs no PyQt5 at
all), and only ever reaches `qt_shell.OUT_ROOT` through `gallery`'s own
already-lazy `_lazy_qt_shell()` (inside `new_output_dir`, at call time, not
at import time). `qt_shell.py` imports `process_wizard` at its own top
level the same safe way it already does `gallery`/`measure`. If
`process_wizard.py` ever needs something from `qt_shell.py` directly
(rather than through `gallery`), make that lazy too, same reasoning.

**`QGlPicamera2` (the embedded live-preview widget) needs a real
GL-capable X session.** It fails with `EGLError: EGL_BAD_ALLOC` when
constructed from a plain exec/tool shell, even with `DISPLAY` correctly set
to a real, running desktop session (`:0`) — this environment's shell just
doesn't have the GL/DRM access a real logged-in session would. This is an
**environment limitation of the exec shell, not a code bug** — the widget
itself was hardware-verified working in earlier sessions. Everything else
in `qt_shell.py` (menus, dialogs, non-GL windows, `FocusPreviewWindow`
itself minus the embedded preview) renders fine under `DISPLAY=:0` — you
just can't construct `Picamera2Camera` (which builds the widget in its
`__init__`) from here.

**Real-hardware testing workaround: drive `Picamera2` directly, skip the
widget.** When you need genuine sensor data (not `FakeCamera`'s synthetic
frames) to prove something works, don't try to construct
`camera_backend.Picamera2Camera`. Instead build `Picamera2` directly with
the same `create_preview_configuration`/`create_still_configuration` calls
`Picamera2Camera.__init__` uses, and drive `switch_mode` +
`capture_request` yourself — this gets you real DNGs off the actual IMX477
without needing the GL widget. Every "verified beyond render-check on real
hardware" claim in the git log this session was done this way. Search the
git log (`git log --all --grep="real hardware"`) for worked examples if
you need to do this again.

**The `calib/` directory at the repo root is the user's own real specimen
data**, not test fixtures — real `.dng` captures and session folders from
actual microscopy sessions (dates predate this session). Never touch,
move, or delete it. It's untracked in git (large binaries) and that's
correct — don't `git add` it.

**Central store paths** (all under `~/.zynergy/` except profile, which sits
in the repo root because the repo happens to live at `~/imx`):
- `~/.zynergy/calibration.json` — spatial (µm/px), keyed by objective
- `~/.zynergy/ca_calibration.json` — chromatic aberration, keyed by objective
- `~/.zynergy/annotations.json` — measurement marks, keyed by `pixel_sha256`
- `~/imx/profile.json` — camera exposure/gain/WB (this repo IS `~/imx`)
- `~/captures/<timestamp>/` — session folders (`session.json` + raw frames)
- `~/captures/adhoc/` — ad hoc wizard-shot images (not full sessions)

All three JSON stores are append-only with a `supersedes` chain — **never**
edit or delete an existing entry when you need a store operation; add a new
one. Every store function that writes does so atomically (temp file, then
`os.replace`).

**Menu integration pattern** (`qt_shell.py`'s Calibrate/Measure menus): both
follow the identical shape — a guarded top-level import
(`try: from . import X as _x / except ImportError: ... / _x = None`), one
menu with one action, the action disabled with a tooltip if the import
failed, and a `_launch_x()` method that reuses an already-open window
(`raise_()` + `activateWindow()`) rather than spawning a duplicate on a
repeat trigger. If you add a fifth tool that needs its own window, copy
this shape exactly — it's proven and tested (see `_launch_calibrate` /
`_launch_measure`).

**`README.md` was refreshed** (`cd6e566`) to match current state — the
stale `zstack_process.py`/standalone-`capture.py` references are gone, and
it now documents `ca_measure.py`, the Calibrate/Measure menus, z-stack
review, and post-capture QC. If you make an architecturally-visible change
(new tool, new menu, a file removed or renamed), update `README.md` in the
same commit rather than letting it drift again.

## Design conventions worth knowing before you add anything

- **Evidence, never a gate.** `poly2_flag`, `sharpness_relative_flag`,
  `calibration_staleness` all follow the same rule: detect and surface a
  problem, but never auto-block or auto-correct. A stale calibration still
  works: the user decides whether to re-measure. A soft z-stack plane still
  displays: the user decides whether to exclude it. If you're tempted to
  add an automatic decision on top of a detector like these, don't —
  that's a deliberate, repeated design choice, not an oversight.
- **Absence is not evidence of a mismatch.** `calibration_staleness` skips
  any field an entry never recorded (an older entry predating a given
  field) rather than flagging it — same principle as above, applied to
  missing data specifically.
- **Pure logic is Qt-free and camera-free**, always in a form
  `--render-check` can exercise with no hardware and (mostly) no PyQt5.
  GUI code is a thin wrapper that calls into it. If you're writing
  something that isn't obviously GUI wiring, it almost certainly belongs
  in the Qt-free section of whichever file, not inline in a widget method.
- **One session (folder) contributes one z-stack plane.** A stack spans
  *across* session folders, tagged via `stacks.apply_tag`/`find_tagged`,
  never assembled from one session's own `captures` list. This tripped up
  an earlier version of `measure.py`'s `_load_stack` badly (it looked for
  a nonexistent `"base"` field and assumed one session held a whole
  stack) — the fix is `stacks.group_by_stack` + `stacks.ordered_planes`
  across multiple session dirs. If z-stack code looks like it's reading
  one session's captures for multiple planes, that's the bug recurring.
- **`--render-check` coverage is the definition of done.** Every commit
  message in the git log that says "Build §N" also says which new
  `--render-check` assertions back it up. Don't consider new logic
  finished without a corresponding self-check; don't trust a GUI method
  without at least a scripted (if not pixel-verified) exercise of it.

## Recommended first move

Run the full `--render-check` sweep (command above) to confirm the
baseline still holds, then read the last handful of commit messages
(`git log -15 --stat`) for the specific reasoning behind the most recent
changes — they're written to be self-contained explanations, not just
summaries.
